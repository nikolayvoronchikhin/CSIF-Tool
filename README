General
-------
- What this tool does is allow you to access the CSIF computers without having to type in the long SSH command, including the pc##. 
- Once you have this tool setup you just type `csif 44` and it will connect to machine # 44 in CSIF.


Security
--------
This program is as secure as the machine itself. This tool does not record, store, trasmit or otherwise tamper with your password. It's pretty simple. 


To access help screen
---------------------

$ csif -h

$ csif -help



To install
----------
Once you have the "csif" executable on your machine, open the terminal (command prompt) and navigate your way to the file.
Then type the following (not including the $ of course):

$ sudo mv ./csif /usr/bin

Your system will prompt you for the password.

Now it's installed! 



To change your username
-----------------------

$ csif -c

$ csif -config



To connect to CSIF over SSH
---------------------------
$ csif <machine-id>

such that 

<machine-id> ::= <number>
<number> ::= { <digit> }
<digit> ::= 1-60
